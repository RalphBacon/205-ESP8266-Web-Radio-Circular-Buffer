# ESP8266 Web Radio and Circular Buffer
As I ported it to an ESP8266 you might as well have a look (no TFT screen support)  

What is going on with my ESP32's WiFi connection?

So we look at WiFi connectivity issues with my ESP32 Dev Board (Revision 0) and then compare its Internet performance with a faultless Wemos Lolin NodeMCU V3 ESP8266.  

We also take a good look at circular buffers which are built into the ESP32 core.
